# Changelog

All notable changes to Aether will be documented in this file.

The project follows semantic versioning once public release candidates begin.
Pre-1.0 versions may still change internal APIs and storage details.

## [0.8.5-alpha] - Unreleased

### Added

- Optional RAG web URL loader that stays disabled by default and only ingests
  explicitly listed HTTP(S) pages when enabled for a dataset.
- Web ingest HTML text extraction with script/style stripping, small page
  limits, URL deduplication, and regression coverage for the default-disabled
  posture.

## [0.8.4-alpha] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Repeatable Linux and Windows archive packaging scripts.
- Linux package layout with desktop launcher metadata, user-local desktop
  install/uninstall scripts, icon asset, license notices, archive, and SHA256.
- Windows package layout with launch helper, license notices, ZIP archive, and
  SHA256.
- App and tray icon assets derived from the Aether branding sheet.
- Packaging documentation covering runtime requirements and self-contained
  builds.
- Refreshed security review and threat model for secrets, local runtimes,
  backup/restore, RAG ingest, tray behavior, and packaging.
- Expanded tests for RAG BM25/hybrid scoring, runtime profile validation,
  secret reference migration, and shell-free process argument construction.
- Opt-in Windows system-wide hotkeys for Quick Chat, New Chat, and Services,
  with Linux reported as unavailable until reliable compositor support exists.

## [0.8.3-alpha]

### Added

- OS credential-store integration for secrets via Linux Secret Service,
  macOS Keychain, and Windows Credential Manager.
- Local fallback secret vault remains available when no OS store is present.

## [0.8.2-alpha]

### Added

- Tray icon with show, quick chat, new chat, services, stop services, and quit
  actions.
- Local hotkeys for quick chat, new chat, services, and closing quick chat.
- Settings toggles for tray icon, minimize-to-tray, and local hotkeys.
- Documentation for tray behavior, local hotkeys, and close-button shutdown
  semantics.

## [0.8.1-alpha]

### Added

- Configurable local AI assets root for models, XTTS, venvs, and encoders.
- Detected-path application for XTTS script/python/voices/output and ONNX
  reranker assets.

### Changed

- Removed machine-specific XTTS script defaults; Aether now asks for a path

### Added

- Central repo version metadata for all assemblies.
- Source-available private/noncommercial licensing posture.
- Commercial licensing documentation.

- RAG ingest, citations, source inspector, traces, eval harness, and ONNX
  reranking.
